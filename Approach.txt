I decided to take an approach similar to the idea of Steering Forces where each object colliding with the Mob would give it a new velocity to move to 
which would be added to other velocities to make the final movement. This does not gaurntee that the mob will not collide with another, but it should 
move it in the direction it needs to move to avoid colliding over time. I also used the colliding mob's mass divided by the current mob's mass as a 
coeffiecient for the added velocity to move smaller mobs more than larger ones. I decided to handle buildings the same way as Mobs by making sure they 
inherit from Attackable (which it seemed like they should have anyways) and giving that a definition of mass which Buildings set to a high number in 
order to max out the new velocity away from them. The river I handled a bit differently as I just checked to see if a mob was within it and moved it 
to whichever side of the river made the most sense. 

I think this collision system works pretty well with mobs that need to move around each other. There are things I could improve like Mobs slowing down 
a bit when going around the corner of something they are colliding with, which seemed like it would be more of a hassle than it is worth. There are also 
some design decisions that I don't feel entirely comfortable with, but they were much simpler than trying to figure out a workaround.
